# Coding Kata: Roman Numerals

Write a class that implements the following interface:

```
public interface RomanNumeralGenerator {

   public String generate(int number);

}
```

For example, see the following sample inputs and outputs:

> 1 = “I”
> 5 = “V”
> 10 = “X”
> 20 = “XX”
> 3999 = “MMMCMXCIX”

Caveat: Only support numbers between 1 and 3999
